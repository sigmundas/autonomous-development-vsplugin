# Verify the feature

Read [references/check-discovery.md](references/check-discovery.md).

1. Discover authoritative commands from repository instructions and CI configuration.
2. Run focused tests for changed behavior first.
   Use one simple command per tool call; do not join unrelated checks with shell operators.
3. Run applicable formatting checks, linters, type checks, unit tests, integration tests, builds, and runtime verification.
4. Record each command through:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/controller.py" run-check --name <name> -- <executable> <arguments...>
```

5. Diagnose and fix failures only when the failure is caused by the implementation. Do not hide, skip, delete, or weaken tests.
6. Report commands, exit status, and log paths.
