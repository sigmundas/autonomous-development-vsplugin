# Independent Codex review

1. Confirm accepted specification, accepted plan, and recorded verification exist.
2. Run:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/controller.py" codex --phase review
```

3. Read the generated review file. Its path is printed by the controller; you can also find it
   via `controller.py status --json` under `reviews[-1].path` (resolved relative to the run
   directory reported by `controller.py show-run`).
4. Summarize the verdict and findings by severity with exact file evidence.
5. Do not edit product files. Finding triage and repairs belong to `/autonomous-development:fix-findings`.
