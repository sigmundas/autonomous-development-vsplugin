# Triage and fix review findings

1. Locate the latest review file and any prior triage files. Use `controller.py status --json`
   to find `reviews[-1].path` (resolved relative to the run directory), or run
   `controller.py show-run` to inspect the full run state.
2. Classify every finding as one of:
   - `accepted`;
   - `rejected_with_evidence`;
   - `already_resolved`;
   - `out_of_scope_but_recorded`;
   - `requires_human_decision`.
3. Record the classification and repository evidence in `triage-NN.md` under the run directory.
4. Fix accepted findings with the smallest coherent change.
5. Add a regression test for every correctness, security, compatibility, or reliability defect when practical.
6. Rerun all affected verification checks using the controller.
7. Do not automatically implement low-confidence stylistic suggestions.
8. Do not exceed the configured review-round budget; mark the run blocked when a safe resolution requires external product or operational authority.
